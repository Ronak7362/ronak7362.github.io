## 📖 How to Use jwt-decode
Once you have successfully downloaded the application, follow these steps to decode your JWT tokens:

1. **Open the Terminal or Command Prompt:**  
   - On Windows, open Command Prompt.  
   - On macOS, open the Terminal app.  
   - On Linux, you can use your favorite terminal emulator.

2. **Navigate to the Downloaded File:**  
   Use the `cd` command to change directory to the location where you downloaded the jwt-decode file. For example:
   ```
   cd ~/Downloads
   ```
   Replace `~/Downloads` with the actual path where the file is located.

3. **Run the Application:**  
   Enter the following command, replacing `jwt-decode` with the actual filename you downloaded:
   ```
   ./jwt-decode <your_jwt_token>
   ```
   Make sure to replace `<your_jwt_token>` with the JWT you want to decode.

4. **View the Output:**  
   The application will decode the token, showing you the information contained within it, such as the header and payload. This will help you understand what the token holds and can assist in troubleshooting any authentication issues.

## 📂 Features
- **Easy Decoding:** Quickly decode JWTs without any programming knowledge.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Interface designed for simplicity, requiring minimal effort to use.
- **Supports Multiple Platforms:** Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Debugging Tool:** Helps in inspecting JWTs for development purposes.

## ❓ Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while using jwt-decode, consider the following tips:

- **Incorrect Token Format:** Ensure your JWT is properly formatted. A valid JWT typically has three parts separated by periods.
  
- **Permission Issues:** If you see "Permission denied" messages, ensure you have the proper permissions to execute the file. You may need to run `chmod +x jwt-decode` on Unix-based systems.

- **Missing Dependencies:** If you get an error about missing libraries, ensure your system has the required packages. For example, you might need to install certain libraries for Linux users.

## 🛡️ Security
While jwt-decode is a helpful tool for debugging, be cautious not to share sensitive JWTs publicly. Tokens might hold confidential user information or access dials. Always handle them securely and responsibly.
